The purpose of this project is to imitate a music recommendation algorithm using unsupervised machine learning. K-Means clustering is used without scaling, then with scaling and then with PCA. A new sample is then created for the final algorithm. This project uses a dataset of songs from 1950 - 2019 that was taken from a research paper published in 2020 titled "Music Dataset: Lyrics and Metadata from 1950 to 2019".
